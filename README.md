# OkCupid Take-Home Exercise

The main decision and problem I ran into had to do with where the state would live. I normally would not have used Redux for an app like this because there is very little global state. What little there is could easily be passed down to children as needed since there would not be much prop drilling involved. This especially comes into play with all the form elements in this app, form elements should keep their data in local state, not global state since no other component cares about their data until it is submitted.

The other main decision I did was to use react-redux hooks instead of containers. In general I think hooks are much easier to reason about, especially with redux that is already verbose. It also removes the need for containers which makes it easier to reason about for other developers reading the code. Lastly, they make you think more deeply about the need to make sure any nested state in the redux store is properly immutable since useSelector will only do a shallow compare. For the component to rerender correctly, the slice of state used in useSelector needs to be handled corretly to ensure a new object is used during the comparison.

This was the other main problem I had, it's been awhile since I've used Redux so it took me a bit to get useSelector to properly rerender but once I figured it out it was not too hard to implement for all the components that needed to ues useSelector.
